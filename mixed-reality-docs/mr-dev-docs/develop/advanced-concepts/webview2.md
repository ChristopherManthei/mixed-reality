# Using WebView2 on HoloLens

As of the Windows 11 version of the HoloLens OS (currently available to insiders), it is now possible to write applications that can take advantage of WebView2 to display rich web content. WebView2 is available directly in WinUI 2 (UWP) applications as well as Unity applications through the WebView2 Plugin.

For WinUI2 (UWP) applications, please review the [Get started with WebView2 in WinUI 2 (UWP) apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/get-started/winui2) tutorial.

For Unity apps, please review the [Get started with WebView2 in HoloLens 2 Unity apps (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/get-started/hololens2) tutorial.
