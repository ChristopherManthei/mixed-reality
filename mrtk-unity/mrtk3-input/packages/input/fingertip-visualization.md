# Fingertip Visualization &#8212; MRTK3

The fingertip affordance helps the user recognize the distance from the target object. The ring shape visual adjusts its size based on the distance from the fingertip to the object. The fingertip visualization is primarily controlled by the `Ring Reticle` and `Ring Magnetism` scripts, which can be found used in the `MRTK LeftHand Controller` prefab. 

 Other components of the visualization include the `MRTK_Ring Cursor` material.
